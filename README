JavaScript 3D Engine
====================

This basic javascript 3D engine renders triangle-strip based geometry using a canvas element. It uses a perspective projection to create the illusion of 3D. It doesn't do backface culling or lighting.

System Design
=============

The engine is really basic and consists of a main "scene" object (Engine) in which geometry (Objects) can be registered. After registration these objects will be .update()-ed each tick after which they are 
immediatly drawn. Everything is drawn every tick.

The perspective formula used is: for each (x,y,z) in "object space", the screen coordinates are: 
	x'screen = x'object / z
	y'screen = y'object / z
