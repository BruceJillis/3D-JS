=Pure JavaScript 3D Engine=

This simple javascript renders triangle strip based geometry on a canvas element. It uses a simple perspective 
projection to create the illusion of 3D. It doesn't do backface culling or lighting as the design is really not
amenable to those kinds of additions.

It was fun developing this little prototype and making it was really educational.

Enjoy!

=System Design=

The engine is really simple and consists of a main "scene" object (Engine) in which geometry (Objects) can be
registered. After registration these objects will be .update()-ed each tick after which they are drawn. 

The perspective formula used is the oldie, but goodie, for each (x,y,z) in "object space", the screen coordinates 
are: 
	x'screen = x'object / z
	y'screen = y'object / z

currently the cube is the only primitive (working and available) in the engine, and I have no plans to add to this.
